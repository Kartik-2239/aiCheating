    1.) Figure out the required language from the text extracted from the image, which can be boilerplate code or just a dropdown menu in where the language is chosen from.
    2.) Extract the exact technical question from the image and solve it in the language extracted from the text.
    3.) Solve the question and give only the coded solution with minimal comments explaining the required thopught process.
    4.) Make sure the comments are made in such a way that someone with basic understanding of coding could understand the solution and explain the reason for each step.
    5.) Don't spoon feed the exact thought process keep it minimal and short just to understand everything on the fly.
